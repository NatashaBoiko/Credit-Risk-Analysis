## Purpose
Use machine learning models that reduce bias and help predict credit risk.

## Overview
We used resampling models, SMOTEENN, ensemble classifiers, to predict credit risk

## Summary

The resampling models did not generate an acceptable model to predict high risk credit(low f1 scores less than 0.08).However the Easy Ensemble Classifier model shows the best results with balance accuracy score of 93% a precison rate of 9% , and sensitivity rate (recall) at 92% compared to the other models.Therefore, the Easy Emsemble Classifier is the best model to use for this type of analysis.It is important to note that the original dataset has a greater number of data that is classified as low-risk compared to high-risk this may skew the results.
